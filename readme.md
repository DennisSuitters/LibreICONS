### LibreICONS v3

The Open Source SVG Icon and CSS toolkit created by [Studio Junkyard](http://www.studiojunkyard.com/)

Born out of frustration of other Font Icon Sets not containing Icons needed when developing [LibreCMS](https://github.com/StudioJunkyard/LibreCMS), we created LibreICONS to fill the gap that we needed, and ended up consolidating all the Font Icons we were using into one set.

Now with release v3 we've deprecated the Font Icons and Sprite Sheets.

Then we decided to share it with you.
