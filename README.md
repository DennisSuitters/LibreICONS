LibreICONS v3 is a Free (as in Cost, and Liberty) SVG Icon Library in much of a similar spirit as Font Awesome, Glyphicons, Summernote, and other great Icons Libraries available.

Why another Icon Library? Well, out of much frustration of other Icon Libraries either having Icons that were needed for Web Development, from watching posts in other Projects for requested Icons, and those requests not being fullfiled or simply ignored. And due to the similar needs of missing Icons from other Libraries for developing [LibreCMS](https://github.com/StudioJunkyard/LibreCMS).

We'll try to include the most requested Icons that aren't, won't, or just taking way to long to be implemented in other Icon Packages, while excluding those that are plainly not needed.

The included icons are sized to fit within 14 x 14.

Icons are originally designed or converted in SVG Format.

#### Themes using LibreICONS
We've been maintaining some themes for other Projects to fit in with LibreCMS, and we want to share them with you. In the `theme` folder you'll find folder for each of the projects we've modified to look more like Bootstrap, but to also include LibreICONS.
- elFinder.
- Summernote Icons.
- Social Icons.
- FullCalendar (being worked on for release).
